- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @cr1pto.

- I'm an experienced software developer who enjoys learning new stuff.
- I've been working on the .NET stack pretty much my entire career.  I started in college with Java and C, as well as Assembly.
- My favorite project that I have is my simple_bible project.  It represents a comprehensive view of a lot of patterns I've been exposed to over the years, including:
  - Dependency Injection
  - State Management
  - Clean Coding approaches
  - Various other OOP patterns
  - Unit Testing
 
- For a project that speaks a little more to technologies I've used on the job, take a look at my StockTickerSample.  It should have various concerns that would be relevant to a microservice and a .NET application running in a Docker container.
- I'm actively engaged in my professional development and have working POCs in Azure on the following stacks:
  - Golang
  - Node.js
  - Python (Django)
  - .NET
  - Java

 - I welcome any professional advice or development.  You're never too old nor experienced to take advice from others! I don't consider myself the smartest guy in the world.  There's always someone who's smarter than you out there and taking a humble approach is better for you long-term.

 - I've been working on my understanding of CompSci algoritms.  I took an Algorithms Analysis class several years ago and have been using the Algorithmics course on pluralsight as a refresher.  There are some concepts that are still there, such as Big O, but some new stuff I never learned -> Big Alpha, Big Omega, for example.
 - I've been really stepping up my understanding of Spring Boot lately and am planning to probably work my way towards Golang or Rust.  Rust in particular has been a language I am especially interested in because of the memory safety it boasts over C++.  I know it's a more challenging language to learn for someone who doesn't have to think about memory management as much as a C++ full-time dev, but ideally there's a project I'd like to build out in Rust that leverages the native Windows SDK for working with Audio.

 - If you made it this far, thanks so much for reading my bio.  I'd love to connect and maybe even work on a project together!

 - Thanks. - @cr1pto.
